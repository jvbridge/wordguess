# Wordguess!

This is a simple word guessing game similar to wordle. 

## Usage

Play a wordguessing game similar to hangman! In order to play simply press
buttons on your keyboard to make guesses. If the guess is correct the letter
will fill in automatically if not, nothing will happen!

Each round is timed, if you finish the word before the timer runs out you get a
win! If not it's counted as a loss.
